## SugarCube 
Built during the **418 Hackathon**, hosted by **Enigma** under **AEON 2025**.

In a world where memories are buried under content and fleeting timelines, **SugarCube** offers something different — a soulful, intentional space to preserve what matters. We live in an age of infinite data but limited emotional storage. Our lives are scattered across platforms, yet there’s nowhere to simply feel, reflect, and return. SugarCube bridges that gap — a personal memory vault designed for emotion, not attention.

## ✍️ Create

You begin by creating. On your **Personal Canvas**, you log memories using photos, captions, moods, emojis, scents, songs, and free-text thoughts — layering emotion with context.

For collective nostalgia, the **Shared Canvas** (prototype) lets friend groups or communities contribute to a joint memory space — like a digital slam book for your people.

A **Routine Tracker** (prototype) encourages mindful self-reflection. Through small daily check-ins, you track emotional habits, build self-awareness, and earn “sugar” points as gentle encouragement.

## 🎞️ Experience

Then, you experience. Your memories resurface as **flashcards** — either through:

- **Timeline View** (calendar-based recall)
- **Shuffle Mode** (randomized surprises)
- **Routine Playback** (a cinematic memory reel)

With each interaction, **Gemini AI** provides thoughtful reflections, emotional pattern recognition, and creative prompts — transforming your past into insight, not noise.

## 💡 Inspiration

We built SugarCube to solve a quiet but real problem: in the race to post, scroll, and forget — the depth of lived experience often gets lost. Inspired by the emotional richness of analog memory-keeping — slam books, mixtapes, journal entries — we set out to design a tool that preserves not just moments, but meaning.

SugarCube isn’t about social metrics. It’s about presence, self-expression, and emotional clarity — a space where memory is respected, layered, and beautifully archived.

## 🌟 What the Project Does

SugarCube is a multi-modal journaling and memory system that lets users log, organize, and revisit life experiences — not as posts, but as emotional artifacts. Users can:

- Log memories with media, tags, scents, and music
- Revisit those memories through flashcards and AI-powered reflections
- Build routines and develop emotional habits over time

## 🔧 How We Built It

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, React Router
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express
- **Database:** MongoDB via Mongoose
- **Auth:** Firebase 
- **Media Storage:** Cloudinary
- **AI:** Gemini Pro API

## ☁️ Memory Storage & Scalability

Right now, SugarCube uses:
- **MongoDB** for structured memory logs  
- **Cloudinary** for media hosting (images, audio, etc.)

This setup works well for small-scale personal and group usage.

As user growth increases and multi-modal memory data expands, we plan to scale with:
- **AWS S3** for scalable asset storage  
- **Amazon RDS** for more structured, high-performance memory retrieval  
- **Redis** for caching frequently accessed memories

All to ensure fast, secure, and permanent access to the past — at any scale.

SugarCube isn’t about sharing with the world — it’s about staying connected to yourself. Because not every memory needs an audience — some just need a place to live.
