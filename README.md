## Overview

SugarCube is a digital sanctuary designed for preserving personal memories and moments. Unlike conventional social media platforms that prioritize public sharing and engagement metrics, SugarCube focuses on private reflection and meaningful memory storage. It provides users with a space to capture and revisit life's emotional, visual, and sensory experiences.

## Motivation

SugarCube was born from a recognized gap in the digital landscape: while numerous platforms exist for sharing curated moments with others, few provide a dedicated space for personal memory preservation.

Traditional memory-keeping methods‚Äîjournals, photo albums, keepsakes‚Äîoffer emotional value through their privacy and permanence. SugarCube brings these qualities into the digital realm, creating a platform that values emotional clarity and authentic self-expression over social validation.

Our inspiration comes from analog memory artifacts: slam books, passed notes, mixtapes, and personal journals‚Äîitems valued not for their reach but for their emotional resonance.
